## Detailed Description
The graphic engine is designed to handle complex scenes by implementing advanced ray tracing algorithms. This technique simulates the way light interacts with objects, providing realistic rendering results. The engine can handle various object types and supports different rendering configurations to achieve high-quality graphics.

## Key Components
1. **Scene Management:** Organizes and manages different objects and their properties within the scene.
2. **Ray Tracing Algorithm:** The core rendering logic that traces rays from the camera through the scene, calculating interactions with objects to determine color and lighting.
3. **Object Support:** Includes primitives like spheres, planes, and more complex shapes.
4. **Lighting and Shading:** Implements different lighting models to enhance realism, including ambient, diffuse, and specular lighting.

## Usage
The graphic engine can be integrated into applications requiring realistic rendering, such as:
- Visualization tools
- Simulations
- Games
- Educational tools

## Future Enhancements
- **Performance Optimization:** Improving the efficiency of the ray tracing algorithm.
- **Additional Object Types:** Supporting more complex geometries and textures.
- **Real-time Rendering:** Exploring real-time capabilities for interactive applications.

This project demonstrates a sophisticated use of Java for high-performance graphics rendering, leveraging ray tracing to produce realistic and visually appealing scenes.
